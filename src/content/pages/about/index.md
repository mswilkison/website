    - question: What is threshold cryptography?
      answer: Threshold cryptography is a revolutionary technology that uses
        cryptography to unlock greater utility and usability for digital assets
        without needing to trust a centralized party. Threshold cryptography
        distributes sensitive operations across multiple independent entities –
        like nodes in a network – and requires a threshold, or minimum number of
        those entities to cooperate for the operation to be successful.
    - question: What staking providers work with Threshold?
      answer: You can refer to the list of staking providers below.

    - question: What determines the exchange rate for T tokens?
      answer:
        As decided by the NU and KEEP communities in the final merge proposal,
        the conversion ratio for each token is based on the total supply rather
        than price. The final total supply of NU is ~1,380,688,920 and the total
        supply of KEEP is ~940,795,010. As a result, the token factors are
        1NU:~3.26T and 1KEEP:~4.78T.

    - question: How did Keep and NuCypher merge?
      answer:
        The Keep and NuCypher communities voted to merge into a single network
        in the RC0 T Token proposal. This resulted in the first ever
        decentralized on-chain network merger and launched Threshold Network.
        The merger resulted in the introduction of a new token (T), the
        Threshold DAO,  and the Threshold Discord server.
